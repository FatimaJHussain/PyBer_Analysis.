# PyBer_Analysis.

# Overview of the analysis
This analysis is performed to define and analyze the ride-sharing data by city type. It will reflect various facts, such as average fare, average number of rides etc. for three types of cities; Urban, Suburban and Rural. Afterwards, multiple-line graph is drawn to reflect the the total monthly fares for each city type.

# Results:

We see different trends in ride-sharing among the different city types. These differences exsist not only total rides, but also in total number of drivers as well as total fares. These differences also leads to differences in average fare per driver and ride as well as total fare by typess of city. Below. we discuss these differences in detail, as shown in Figure 1:

Figure-1: Ride Sharing Trends ![Ride_Sharing_Trends](https://github.com/FatimaJHussain/PyBer_Analysis./blob/main/Analysis/PyBer_ridesharing_trends.png), 
## Total Number of Rides
Urban cities have maximum number of rides: 1625 and Rural cities has minimum number of rides: 125. While Suburban cities find thier place in the middle with total rides:625. It shows that Urban cities utilize these ride sharing services, compared to other two types.
## Total Number of Drivers and Average Fare per Driver
Rural cities have least number of drivers:78, having average fare being $55.49, which is quiet good. Average fare per ride is $34.62, while drivers get $55.49, this means lots of benefits and relaxation is given to drivers in Rural cities to promote ride sharing services. On the contrary, we see large number of drivers in Urban cities:2405, obtaing average fare of $16.57, which is not that good. This means that, almost $8-9 have been taken away in taxes; as average fare per ride is $24.52 and driver gets just $16.57 on average.  While Suburban cities have 490 drivers with moderate fare of $39.50 on average, with average fare of $30.97, which is good nad balanced compared to two extremes in Urban and Rural cities, we have seen in terms of average fare per drivers.

## Total Fare and Average Fare per Ride
Average fare per ride is pretty low in Urban cities: $24.52 and it is very good as more  people can benefit from ride sharing services. Average fare per ride in Rural cities is $34.62 and it is not that high as compared to urban cities.  

## Ride Sharing Trends per  1st Quarter
In the Figure-2, ride sharing trends are displayed over 1st quarter of a year, i.e January,Feburary, March and April. We can see that urban cities sre  leading this trends with visible jump.

# Summary:

* Ride sharing trends demonstrates that urban cities have the maximum number of drivers, but average fare per driver is the lowest. This situation can be improved by relaxing tax deductions and managemnt charges in urban cities.  In this way, net money going to the driver will increase.

* Rural cities have less drivers and have more fare being charged by travellers. If incentives are given to potentially new drivers, more people will join and there will be more available drivers and rides. Eventually, it will reduce the average fare charged from travellers.
